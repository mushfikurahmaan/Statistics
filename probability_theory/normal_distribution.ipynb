    "### Introduction\n",
    "Normal distribution, often referred to as the Gaussian distribution, is a fundamental concept in statistics and probability theory. It describes how data points are distributed in a symmetrical, bell-shaped curve, centered around the mean. This distribution is essential for various fields, including psychology, finance, natural and social sciences, and machine learning, as it helps in understanding and interpreting data trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition\n",
    "Normal distribution is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, indicating that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. In simpler terms, it represents a continuous probability distribution for a random variable that is defined by its mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formula\n",
    "The probability density function (PDF) of a normal distribution is defined by the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "f(x) = \\frac{1}{\\sigma \\sqrt{2\\pi}} e^{-\\frac{(x - \\mu)^2}{2\\sigma^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $ f(x) $ is the probability density function.\n",
    "- $ \\mu $ is the mean of the distribution.\n",
    "- $ \\sigma $ is the standard deviation.\n",
    "- $ e $ is the base of the natural logarithm (approximately equal to 2.71828).\n",
    "- $ x $ represents the variable of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Characteristics\n",
    "Normal distribution has several key characteristics that define its shape and behavior:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Symmetry**: The distribution is symmetric around the mean ($ \\mu $), meaning that the left and right sides of the curve are mirror images.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Mean, Median, and Mode**: In a normal distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all equal and located at the center of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Bell-shaped Curve**: The graph of the normal distribution is bell-shaped, with the highest point at the mean. The curve approaches the horizontal axis but never touches it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **68-95-99.7 Rule**: Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean $ \\mu \\pm \\sigma $, 95% falls within two standard deviations $ \\mu \\pm 2\\sigma $, and 99.7% falls within three standard deviations $ \\mu \\pm 3\\sigma $.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Asymptotic**: The tails of the curve approach the horizontal axis but never actually touch it, indicating that there is a non-zero probability of extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Normal Distribution\n",
    "Normal distribution can be used in various scenarios, particularly when:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The sample size is large (typically $ n > 30 $) according to the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the means of large samples drawn from any distribution will be approximately normally distributed.\n",
    "- The data is continuous and can be assumed to be symmetrically distributed around a central value.\n",
    "- The underlying process generating the data is random, and the distribution of measurements can be described by a mean and standard deviation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Real-World Applications\n",
    "Normal distribution has a wide range of real-world applications across various fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Psychology**: Used in intelligence testing, where IQ scores are typically distributed normally.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Finance**: Stock prices and returns often follow a normal distribution, aiding in risk assessment and portfolio management.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Quality Control**: Manufacturers use normal distribution to monitor product quality, ensuring that measurements fall within specified limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Natural and Social Sciences**: Many biological and social phenomena, such as heights, weights, and test scores, exhibit normal distribution patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Machine Learning**: Algorithms often assume that the features are normally distributed, which is crucial for certain statistical techniques like linear regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Example\n",
    "**Problem**: A factory produces light bulbs with a mean lifespan of 1200 hours and a standard deviation of 100 hours. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. What percentage of light bulbs last between 1100 and 1300 hours?\n",
    "   \n",
    "**Solution**:\n",
    "Using the 68-95-99.7 rule:\n",
    "- The range of 1100 to 1300 hours is one standard deviation from the mean (1200 hours).\n",
    "- Approximately 68% of the light bulbs will last between 1100 and 1300 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more precise calculation, we can use the Z-score formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Z = \\frac{(X - \\mu)}{\\sigma}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculating the Z-scores for 1100 and 1300 hours:\n",
    "- For 1100 hours: \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Z = \\frac{(1100 - 1200)}{100} = -1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  \n",
    "- For 1300 hours: \n",
    "  $$\n",
    "  Z = \\frac{(1300 - 1200)}{100} = 1\n",
    "  $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the standard normal distribution table, we find:\n",
    "- The area to the left of $ Z = -1 $ is approximately 0.1587.\n",
    "- The area to the left of $ Z = 1  $ is approximately 0.8413.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the area between $ Z = -1 $ and $ Z = 1 $:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{Area} = 0.8413 - 0.1587 = 0.6826 \\text{ or } 68.26\\%\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, approximately 68.26% of the light bulbs will last between 1100 and 1300 hours.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "Normal distribution is a critical concept in statistics, offering insights into data trends and variability. Its key characteristics, such as symmetry, the bell-shaped curve, and the 68-95-99.7 rule, provide a framework for understanding how data behaves in various fields. While normal distribution is widely applicable, the Poisson distribution serves specific contexts involving rare events. Understanding both distributions equips researchers and practitioners with the tools needed to analyze and interpret data effectively."
